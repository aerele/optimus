"""Phase-2 picker: turn phase-1 results into a candidate function list and
resolve free-form dotted paths typed by the customer.

The picker has two responsibilities:

1. **Curated list**: walk the pyinstrument call trees attached to phase-1
   actions, aggregate Python frames by dotted path and return the top-N
   candidates with cumulative_ms + hit_count + app + framework-membership
   metadata. The form UI uses this for its multi-select.

2. **Free-form resolution**: given a dotted path the customer typed
   (``my_app.tasks.heavy_job``), import the module, walk attribute access,
   and validate eligibility for ``line_profiler``. C-extensions / builtins
   lack ``__code__`` and cannot be line-profiled; lambdas and Server
   Scripts (filename starts with ``<``) are similarly out-of-scope.

This module is **pure**: no Frappe DB / Redis access. The API endpoint
(``api.py``) loads the parsed call trees from the Optimus Session and
passes them to ``_build_candidates_from_trees``.
