"""Phase-2 results processor.

Turns the aggregated `results_json` blob (one entry per picked function with
per-line timings) into report-friendly findings + per-function aggregate.

Two functions, mirroring the phase-1 ``analyze.run`` ↔ ``analyzers/*``
split:

- ``analyze(results_json)`` is the **pure** classifier — testable in
  isolation, no Frappe / Redis access.
- ``run_analyze(session_uuid, run_uuid)`` is the **impure** RQ entry
  point — pulls samples from Redis, calls aggregate_samples, calls
  analyze, persists to the Optimus Phase Two Run row, propagates findings
  to the parent Session, triggers re-render, publishes realtime events.
