"""End-to-end recording lifecycle against a real Frappe bench.

The canonical smoke test for the whole capture → analyze → render pipeline:

  1. ``api.start`` creates an ``Optimus Session`` DocType row AND a
     ``profiler:active:<user>`` Redis pointer.
  2. The session is in ``Recording`` state, addressable by uuid.
  3. ``api.stop`` clears the active pointer + marks status ``Stopping``
     + enqueues (or inline-runs) the analyze job.
  4. Within the polling window, the session lands on a terminal state
     (``Ready`` on success, ``Failed`` if the analyze raised).
  5. On Ready, the report HTML file is attached + the session carries
     plausible totals.

This single test exercises:

  * the recorder monkey-patch installed at app-import time
    (``optimus/__init__.py::_patch_recorder``)
  * the v0.7.x bg-tracking trilogy's per-job meta writes (no bg jobs
    triggered here, but the path stays open)
  * the analyze enqueue + RQ job + the full renderer pipeline
  * the File-attach step that persists the report next to the session

Failure here means the integration layer broke. Pure-pytest can verify
every component in isolation but cannot catch a regression in the
inter-component handoff that's what this test is for.
