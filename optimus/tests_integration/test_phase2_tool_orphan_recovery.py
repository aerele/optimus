"""Real-bench integration test for v0.7.x ``_startup_probe_tool2`` recovery.

On Python 3.12+ line_profiler drives the process-global
``sys.monitoring`` PROFILER_ID (tool 2). A botched Phase-2 per-request
teardown (the pre-``fbf3179`` code paired ``enable_by_count()`` with
``disable()``, occasionally raising ``ValueError: tool 2 is not in
use``) left tool 2's LINE events registered process-wide → every
subsequent request in that worker line-traced → CPU peg + frozen UI.

The pre-``fbf3179`` failure mode required a ``bench restart`` to
recover. The ``fbf3179`` fix added two things:
  * ``capture.release_monitoring_tool()``: idempotent unwinder called
    from the after_* hooks (covered by the unit suite's
    ``test_line_profile_monitoring.py``).
  * ``optimus._startup_probe_tool2()``: worker-respawn recovery: if
    tool 2 is owned by line_profiler at app-import (i.e. the prior
    worker died mid-Phase-2 and its line-tracing state survived the
    process restart in the *same Python process group*), the probe
    reclaims it.

The unit suite (``test_line_profile_monitoring.py``) covers the
release helper at the function-call boundary. It cannot prove:

  * That the worker-respawn probe at ``optimus.__init__`` actually
    reclaims a leaked tool 2 in a real Frappe bench. Under pytest the
    probe runs against the Frappe stub.
  * That the probe correctly **declines to reclaim** tool 2 when it's
    owned by a non-line_profiler tool (a third-party debugger or
    profiler). The probe must respect ownership boundaries.

That gap is what this integration test fills. The tests invoke
``optimus._startup_probe_tool2`` directly against manipulated
``sys.monitoring`` state same shape as the unit tests'
``_leak_tool`` helper, but exercised in a real-bench context.

A note on "simulating worker respawn": we can't actually fork a
worker mid-Phase-2 and re-import optimus inside a test (the optimus
module is already loaded). Instead, the test manipulates the
``sys.monitoring`` state to mirror what a leaked tool 2 looks like
after a worker death, then calls the probe directly. This exercises
the probe's recovery logic which is the contract under test.
