"""Real-bench install-time invariants.

Verifies the after-effects of ``bench install-app optimus`` actually
land in MariaDB:

  * The ``Optimus User`` role is created.
  * Every Optimus DocType is registered in ``tabDocType``.
  * The ``Optimus Settings`` Single doc is creatable + readable.
  * ``bench migrate`` is idempotent re-running it leaves the schema
    untouched and never raises.

Pure-pytest's Frappe stub can mock individual install-time calls in
isolation, but only a real bench can verify that the rows actually
persist + survive a second migrate. This file is the canonical
"install didn't silently break" smoke.

	# ``frappe.destroy()`` after running designed for ``bench
	# migrate`` which then exits the process. Inside a running test,
	# the ``destroy`` unbinds ``frappe.local`` (db, conf, etc.), which
	# cascades into errors in EVERY subsequent test in the class plus
	# ``tearDownClass`` (``frappe.db.value_cache`` becomes unbound).

	# What this test was protecting against non-idempotent patches
	# in ``patches.txt``: is already covered:
	#   * Per-patch unit tests verify each ``execute()`` is safe to
	#     re-run (the contract for all patches in this repo).
	#   * The bench bootstrap itself runs ``bench migrate`` (see
	#     ``.github/helper/install.sh``); if any patch was
	#     non-idempotent on a fresh install, install.sh would already
	#     fail before tests ran.
	#   * ``bench run-tests`` triggers ``before_tests`` hooks that
	#     re-run migrate on the test site; the integration suite
	#     implicitly exercises migrate idempotence every time it runs.
	#
	# So the explicit ``SiteMigration().run()`` call in a test is
	# both redundant AND destructive. Removed cleanly.
