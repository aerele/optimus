"""Pytest fixtures for the real-bench integration suite.

This module is **only imported under ``bench --site … run-tests``**: the
pure-pytest workflow at ``.github/workflows/tests.yml`` invokes
``pytest optimus/tests/`` and never traverses this directory, so the
Frappe stub in ``optimus/tests/conftest.py`` doesn't apply here.

The fixtures assume a live Frappe site is initialised (``frappe.init`` +
``frappe.connect`` have already run Frappe's test runner does this
before importing the test modules). Direct Frappe access (``frappe.db``,
``frappe.cache``, ``frappe.get_doc`` etc.) is the whole point the unit
suite stubs them, the integration suite uses them.

Fixtures:

* :func:`test_site`: yields the site name. Tests rarely need it
  explicitly (frappe.local already knows), but it's useful for assertions
  and for shelling out to ``bench --site {test_site} …``.
* :func:`cleanup_session` (autouse) defence-in-depth teardown that
  hard-deletes any ``Optimus Session`` rows left behind plus their
  ``profiler:*`` Redis keys. ``FrappeTestCase`` already rolls back the
  per-test transaction, but the analyze pipeline writes through a
  background-worker connection that escapes the transaction in production
  flows and the Redis state isn't transactional either way.
* :func:`seeded_session`: convenience wrapper that calls ``api.start``,
  yields the session_uuid, and on teardown calls ``api.stop`` and waits
  for analyze to finalise. Used by the lifecycle test.
