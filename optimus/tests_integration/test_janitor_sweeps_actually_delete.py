"""Real-bench integration test for ``janitor.sweep_old_sessions`` deletion.

The janitor's ``sweep_old_sessions`` (``optimus/janitor.py:96-139``) is
the daily cron that enforces the retention policy: Ready / Failed
sessions older than ``DEFAULT_RETENTION_DAYS`` (90, configurable via
``site_config.optimus_session_retention_days``) get hard-deleted. The
hard cap of ``MAX_DELETIONS_PER_RUN`` (100) prevents a single sweep
from locking up MariaDB on a large backlog.

The unit suite covers individual sweep functions in isolation
(`test_janitor.py`) but mocks the actual deletion. It cannot prove:

  * That the cron does, in fact, delete the underlying DocType row
    (not just mark or move it).
  * That attached File rows (``raw_report_file``) get deleted along
    with the session orphan File rows would inflate disk usage
    forever, even though the parent session is gone.
  * That the cutoff math is correct: a session 100 days old → deleted;
    a session 30 days old → kept (with the default 90-day retention).
  * That **active** sessions (Recording, Analyzing, Stopping, etc.)
    are untouched regardless of age the daily sweep only prunes
    terminal-state sessions; the 5-minute sweep handles the others.

That gap is what this final integration test fills. Each test creates
a synthetic Optimus Session with an explicit ``started_at`` /
``status``, calls ``janitor.sweep_old_sessions()``, and asserts the
post-sweep state.

This is the **seventh and final** row of the v0.11.0 deferred-tests
extraction roadmap. After this PR, the integration suite covers every
high-impact scenario the v0.7.x architecture review identified.
