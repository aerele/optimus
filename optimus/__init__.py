# The Frappe recorder snapshots ``frappe.local.form_dict`` + ``request.headers``
# at ``Recorder.__init__`` and stores each ``frappe.db.sql`` call's
# post-substitution query string at ``Recorder.register``. Both writes land
# in Redis (``RECORDER_REQUEST_HASH``) verbatim, then get persisted into the
# ``Optimus Session`` DocType's JSON blobs at analyze. Customers who export
# the report or back up their DB have, in effect, exfiltrated raw passwords /
# tokens / cookies.
#
# Pre-v0.7.x+ the renderer ran ``_redact_sensitive`` / ``_redact_sql_literals``
# at render time as a last line of defense. That left a window where raw
# values existed in Redis + on disk. The architecture review (Critical Risk
# #1) called this out; this patch closes it by redacting at the earliest
# point we control when the Recorder captures.
#
# Patch surface:
#   - ``Recorder.__init__``: after the original sets ``self.form_dict`` /
#     ``self.headers``, walk them via ``redaction.redact_sensitive`` so the
#     values reach ``dump()`` already scrubbed.
#   - ``Recorder.register(data)``: before ``_original_register(data)``,
#     replace ``data["query"]`` with its redacted form so the SQL string
#     stored in ``self.calls`` never carried the original literal.
#
# Idempotent via the ``_profiler_patched`` marker (same pattern as

# failure never breaks a customer's request degrades gracefully back to

# On Python 3.12+ line_profiler claims sys.monitoring.PROFILER_ID (tool 2).
# If a worker died mid-Phase-2 without running its after_request finally
# (or hit the pre-6f66a43 teardown bug), tool 2 stays owned by
# "line_profiler" process-globally and the next request to that worker
# inherits the orphan AND gets line-traced. The pre-arm self-heal in
# optimus/line_profile/hooks.py covers Phase 2 paths but only fires when
# the NEXT Phase 2 request runs; every interim request between worker
# boot and that Phase 2 fire pays the line-trace tax.
#
# This probe runs ONCE at app-import (between _patch_recorder and
# _try_install_capture_wraps) and:
#
#   * Auto-reclaims tool 2 when it's owned by "line_profiler" the
#     worker-respawn-after-crash case and LOGS the recovery so the
#     event is visible in journalctl + Error Log.
#   * Logs LOUDLY when tool 2 is owned by an unknown component (third-
#     party profiler / debugger / future Python change), but does NOT
#     touch the tool. Phase 2 will conflict; the operator decides.
#   * Silent (and a no-op) on Python < 3.12 (no sys.monitoring) or when
