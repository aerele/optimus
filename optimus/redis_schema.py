"""Versioned value envelope + schema-version sentinel for Optimus's
Redis state.

The v0.12.0 release establishes the foundation: a single source-of-truth
for the schema version (:data:`SCHEMA_VERSION`), a sentinel key written at
app import (:func:`write_schema_sentinel`), and a pair of opt-in
envelope helpers (:func:`wrap_value`, :func:`unwrap_value`) that future
schema changes can use to keep new code safe against in-flight Redis
values from older releases.

**The contract for future schema changes:**

1. Bump :data:`SCHEMA_VERSION` (in this module AND in
   :data:`optimus.redis_keys.SCHEMA_VERSION`: they must stay in sync).
2. On the WRITE side, wrap the new-shape payload via :func:`wrap_value`
   before passing to ``frappe.cache.set_value`` / ``hset`` / etc.
3. On the READ side, unwrap via :func:`unwrap_value`. The helper
   returns ``(payload, version)``:
   - ``version == SCHEMA_VERSION`` → use ``payload`` directly.
   - ``version is None`` → legacy un-enveloped value; treat as bare
     payload (backward-compat path; eventually migrate it on next write).
   - ``version != SCHEMA_VERSION`` → unknown / future schema; the helper
     returns the caller's ``default`` so the host code path degrades
     gracefully.

**What this release does NOT do:**

* It does NOT wrap any existing value. Every current ``set_value`` /
  ``hset`` / ``rpush`` call writes the same bytes it always did. The
  unwrap helper is opt-in for new code; legacy values without ``_v``
  flow through the unchanged-read path.
* It does NOT change the HMAC envelope (``sign_blob`` / ``unsign_blob``
  in :mod:`optimus.session`). Adding a version tag inside the signed
  envelope is a follow-up with its own migration story.
* It does NOT drive proactive janitor sweeps off the sentinel value.
  Reactive cleanup-on-read is sufficient for the foundation. A future
  release can add a janitor pass that enumerates ``profiler:*`` keys
  and migrates / purges those with mismatched versions.

This module imports nothing from Frappe at module top the helpers
lazy-import inside their functions so pure-pytest tests can exercise
the envelope logic without a bench. The sentinel-write path requires
Frappe (it writes to ``frappe.cache``) but degrades silently when
unavailable.
