# actionable-vs-observation routing inside the report (architectural
# distinction); this tuple decides what to hide ENTIRELY on day one
# (UX choice). Bump it together with FRAMEWORK_APPS only when a new
# Frappe-org app is clearly noise for the typical custom-app
# developer. Sorted alphabetically so the seeded rows have a stable,
# predictable order in the Settings form.
