"""Redis state for the profiler session lifecycle.

This module is intentionally pure state-management no business logic, no
DocType I/O, no recorder coupling. It owns three Redis key shapes:

    profiler:active:<user_email>          → string, value=session_uuid, TTL
    profiler:session:<uuid>:meta          → hash with {started_at, user, label}
    profiler:session:<uuid>:recordings    → set of recording UUIDs

The active key has a TTL that matches the recorder's auto-disable so a
forgotten Stop button can never run forever. The meta and recordings keys
have no TTL they live until the analyze pipeline finalizes the session
into a `Optimus Session` DocType row and explicitly deletes them.
