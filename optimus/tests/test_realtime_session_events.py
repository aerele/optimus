"""Source-inspection guards for the v0.5.1 realtime session-event
contract.

v0.5.1 replaces the widget's per-5-second HTTP polling of
``/api/method/optimus.api.status`` with Socket.IO push
events. The contract is:

  Server publishes:
    - optimus_session_stopping    (from api._stop_session)
    - optimus_session_analyzing   (from analyze.run, at the top)
    - optimus_session_ready       (from analyze.run, at success)
    - optimus_session_failed      (from analyze.run, on exception)
    - optimus_progress            (existing multiple points in analyze.run)

  Client subscribes to all five and also calls status() once at
  page-load + on visibility-change (no setInterval).

Breaking any part of this silently reverts the widget to polling-
timeout lag or leaves state transitions invisible to other tabs.
These source-inspection tests catch regressions at CI time.
