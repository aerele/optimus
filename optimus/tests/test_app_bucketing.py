"""Tests for v0.5.2 per-app sub-grouping inside Findings and Observations.

User request: "the framework and other 1 party app's scripts can be
easy avoided and focus on their custom app". The renderer buckets
findings by their callsite's top-level app (apps/myapp/... → myapp),
puts tracked apps first, then remaining apps by total impact, and
falls "Other (no callsite)" into a tail bucket.
