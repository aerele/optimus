"""v0.6.x: tests for ``patches/v0_6_0/rename_phase_two_doctype.py``: the
one-time DocType rename from ``Profiler Phase 2 Run`` →
``Profiler Phase Two Run`` (audit item 2.6). The patch ran BEFORE the
v0.7.0 app rename, so the DocType names here stay Profiler-prefixed;
the v0.7.0 ``rename_doctypes_to_optimus`` patch renames them on top.

Stubs ``frappe`` so we can drive the patch through every branch (old
exists, both exist, neither exists, rename fails) without a real bench."""
