"""Tests for v0.5.2 round 4 clickable callsite → editor deep-link.

A finding's absolute-path callsite renders as a clickable anchor using
the ``vscode://file`` URL scheme VS Code, VS Code Insiders, and
Cursor all register this handler on install, so the link jumps the
developer straight to the file:line in their editor with one click.

Bench-relative (non-absolute) paths render as plain text since the
``vscode://file`` URL scheme requires an absolute filesystem path.
