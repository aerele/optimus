"""Smoke tests for frontend assets (widget JS, form JS, CSS).

Full browser integration tests would need cypress/playwright, which is
heavy to set up. These cheap smoke tests just verify that the JS files
parse, that the widget's state machine symbols are present, and that the
CSS selectors look sane. Good enough to catch regressions where someone
accidentally breaks the syntax or deletes a critical hook.

Run with `pytest optimus/tests/test_frontend_assets.py -v`.
