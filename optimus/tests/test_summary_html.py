"""Tests for `analyze._build_summary_html`: the plain-language "Summary"
prose at the top of the report.

It must read for a non-developer: "operations" not "actions", humanized
action names ("Submit Sales Invoice") not raw `cmd:action` strings,
"high priority" not "high-severity" and a finding's raw `cmd:action`
reference swapped for the humanized form. The issue count must equal the
sum of the high/medium/low breakdown.
