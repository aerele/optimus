"""Tests for the X-Optimus-Recording-Id response header injection (v0.5.0).

The correlation header is read by the browser-side optimus_frontend.js
shim to tie each XHR timing back to a specific server recording. The
Access-Control-Expose-Headers entry is load-bearing: without it, browsers
refuse to surface the custom header to JavaScript, even for same-origin
requests. That's the #1 failure mode in frontend instrumentation.
