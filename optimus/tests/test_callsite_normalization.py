"""Tests for the v0.5.3 callsite-shape normalizer.

Two analyzers produce two different callsite shapes:

  n_plus_one / redundant_calls / explain_flags:
      callsite = {"filename": "...", "lineno": 456, "function": "..."}

  top_queries (Slow Query findings):
      callsite = "apps/myapp/foo.py:456"   # pre-formatted string

Before the normalizer, ``_app_from_finding`` crashed on the string
shape with ``AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'``
on any session containing Slow Query findings. Production trigger:
a Purchase Order Approve session on bluspring_customization hit
this and failed to generate any report at all.

_finding_to_dict now normalizes at load time; _app_from_finding
double-checks so direct callers (tests, retry paths, future direct
consumers of _bucket_findings_by_app) can't crash on un-normalized
data either.
