"""Pins the removal of the 'Analyzer notes' section from the report.

History: pre-v0.5.2 the analyzer suppression warnings ("Suppressed N SQL
findings from framework code", "Skipped M non-SELECT statements", …) were
concatenated into a single <p> in the header a wall of text. v0.5.2 moved
them to a collapsed-by-default section at the bottom with a short header
pointer. v0.6.x dropped the header pointer; then the section itself was
removed entirely (the suppression bookkeeping is debug noise the report
doesn't need to surface). ``session_doc.analyzer_warnings`` is still computed
and stored on the DocType it's just no longer rendered. Truncation, the one
warning users *do* need to see, has its own prominent banner at the top
(``truncation_banner``) independent of this.

This test makes sure a future edit can't accidentally re-introduce the
section, the header pointer, or the "Notes" link in the "Jump to:" nav.
