"""Tests for v0.5.2 round 3 noise-floor + framework-DocType filters
in explain_flags.

Production report had ~85 'Full table scan on tab<DocType>' findings
at 0-1ms impact, most on stock Frappe DocTypes (tabDocField,
tabWorkspace, tabCustom Field, ...). App developers can't add an
index to those and the ~0ms impact means even if they could the
cost wouldn't be measurable. Two filters now suppress these:

1. Noise floor findings with impact < 5ms AND count < 5 drop
2. Framework DocType filter scans on stock DocTypes drop
