"""Tests for the redundant_calls analyzer.

v0.5.2: the analyzer now requires a caller_stack on each sidecar
entry and filters findings whose callsite is inside frappe/*
framework code (user can't act on framework loops). The fixture
builder in this file sets a DEFAULT user-code stack so existing
tests keep verifying the core aggregation logic; two new tests
exercise the framework-filter + no-stack fallback paths.
