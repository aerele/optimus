"""Tests for v0.5.3 adaptive truncation cap + prominent banner.

Two related changes:

  1. ``max_queries_per_recording`` is now admin-configurable via
     Optimus Settings (default 2000). Long flows (Manufacturing
     Plan Submit with 3000+ queries/recording) can raise it to
     5000 or 10000 to get full-coverage analysis.

  2. When truncation happens, a prominent red banner renders at the
     TOP of the report above the exec-summary card. Previously
     the warning was buried in the collapsed Analyzer Notes at the
     bottom and developers read incomplete reports without
     noticing.
