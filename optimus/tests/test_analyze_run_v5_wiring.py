"""Source-inspection regression guards for analyze.py's analyzer wiring.

analyze.run is a large orchestrator that's hard to exercise end-to-end without
a running Frappe site, so these guard against silent removal or renaming of the
integration points by checking the wiring symbols literally appear in the source.
