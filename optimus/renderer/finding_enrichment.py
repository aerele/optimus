"""Finding enrichment helpers — extracted from ``_internal.py``
incrementally to keep the renderer-package boundary clean.

Two phases shipped so far:

  * **Phase 1 (v0.12.16)** — three pure-function helpers with
    minimal back-coupling to ``_internal.py``:
    - ``_root_cause_key(finding)`` — ``(basename, function)``
      deepest-user-code anchor for finding grouping.
    - ``_group_findings_by_root_cause(findings)`` — collapse
      same-root-cause findings into one primary +
      ``sub_findings`` list.
    - ``_normalize_callsite(callsite)`` — dict-or-string callsite
      shape normalization.

  * **Phase 2 (v0.12.19)** — the drill-down chain attachers (a
    self-contained sub-cluster of the larger finding-enrichment
    family that depends only on stdlib + ``call_tree_renderer.
    _ct_is_other_frame`` + a lazy ``optimus.analyzers.base.
    is_framework_callsite`` import):
    - ``_find_node_in_tree(tree, basename, function)`` — DFS for
      a node by (basename, function).
    - ``_walk_drilldown_chain(tree, callsite, ...)`` — hottest-
      child traversal below a finding's origin frame.
    - ``_attach_drilldown_chains(findings, actions, ...)`` —
      in-place attachment of the chain onto each finding's
      ``technical_detail``.

Plus the ``_GROUPING_SEVERITY_RANK`` constant phase 1 shares.

Still in ``_internal.py`` (the HIGH-coupling subset that needs the
larger source-resolution helper family to move with it, or an
expanded back-import design):

  * ``_finding_to_dict`` (~200 LOC, the main render-dict builder).
  * ``_attach_representative_callsites`` (calls
    ``_action_dotted_entry``, ``_skip_decorators_to_def``,
    ``_resolve_dotted_to_code``, ``_action_entry_callsite``,
    ``_resolve_frame_key_to_callsite``, ``_bench_relative_display``).
  * ``_expand_self_time_snippets`` (calls ``_decorator_through_def_rows`` →
    ``_find_header_def_line`` / ``_source_lines``).
  * ``_retarget_phase1_callsites_to_drilldown_leaf`` + its AST
    helper ``_find_call_line_in_function_body``.
