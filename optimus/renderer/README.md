# `optimus.renderer`: package layout & extraction recipe

`optimus.renderer` turns a fully-analyzed `Optimus Session` row into the
self-contained safe-report HTML. v0.10.0+ it's a **package** that
aggregates per-concern submodules; pre-v0.10.0 it was a single 4,958-line
`optimus/renderer.py` file.

This README is the future-author roadmap: why the package exists, the
recipe to extract more clusters, the structural-snapshot canary that
protects the template contract, and what's still in `_internal.py`
waiting for a follow-up PR.

## Why a package

The monolith was the app's biggest maintainability hazard. Touching one
helper rippled across 15+ callers spread over 3,000+ lines of context;
code review became "find the section" before it became "review the
change"; new contributors faced a steep on-ramp; the safe-report layer
is exactly where a dev shop using Optimus would want to extend, and it
was the hardest place to extend safely.

The package split does **not** rewrite logic it relocates self-contained
clusters into named modules. The output HTML stays byte-equivalent (and
the structural-snapshot test below enforces that across every
extraction).

                           #    _resolve_frame_key_to_callsite
```

All eight submodules are imported back into `_internal.py` under their
original names so legacy call sites resolve unchanged. The package's
`__init__.py` walks `dir(_internal)` and re-exports every non-dunder name
including underscore-prefixed internals so external callers
(`analyze.py`, `api.py`, the test suite) see exactly the surface they saw
pre-split.

## The extraction recipe (for follow-up PRs)

1. **Identify a self-contained cluster.** Look for a group of functions
   that only call each other + standard helpers (no calls back into
   `_internal.py`). The Plan agent's analysis table at the bottom of this
   file lists the remaining candidates with coupling estimates.

2. **Create the new submodule.** Copy the cluster's functions + any
   module-level constants they depend on into `optimus/renderer/<name>.py`.
   Add the standard file header (copyright + a 1-paragraph docstring
   describing the module's purpose).

3. **Delete the originals from `_internal.py`.** Then add an explicit
   `from optimus.renderer.<name> import …` at the top of `_internal.py`
   that re-introduces every name the rest of `_internal.py` still uses.

4. **Run the structural snapshot test.** `pytest
   optimus/tests/test_renderer_structure_snapshot.py -v` must stay green.
   If the fingerprint changed, you've either changed the DOM (revisit the
   extraction) or you've legitimately added a new template section (the
   one snapshot regeneration recipe is below).

5. **Run the full suite.** `pytest optimus/tests/ -q
   --ignore=optimus/tests/test_pdf_export.py` must stay at the current
   passing count + any tests you add.

Add a one-line CHANGELOG entry under the current dev release noting which
cluster moved + the new submodule name.

## The structural snapshot canary

`optimus/tests/test_renderer_structure_snapshot.py` renders a synthetic
session through `render_raw()` and asserts a **structural fingerprint**
against a checked-in golden at `optimus/tests/fixtures/renderer_structure.json`:

* the sorted set of `id="…"` values that appear (which sections rendered)
* the sorted multiset of `class="…"` tokens (which CSS classes were used)
* the per-tag count across the whole document (gross DOM-shape sanity)

The pre-v0.10.0 test suite locked **content** ("the string '50× hits'
appears in the HTML") but never **structure**: a refactor that renamed
`<div class="finding-card">` to `<section class="finding">` would have
passed every existing test and silently broken the (frozen) template's
CSS. The snapshot closes that gap.

**Regenerating the snapshot.** When a legitimate template change lands
(a new section, a renamed CSS class, an added data attribute), the
snapshot test fails with a focused diff. To accept the new shape:

```bash
REGENERATE_RENDERER_SNAPSHOT=1 \
  env/bin/python -m pytest \
  optimus/tests/test_renderer_structure_snapshot.py::TestStructureSnapshot::test_fingerprint_matches_golden
```

The test rewrites `fixtures/renderer_structure.json` and exits with a
skip. Commit the updated fixture alongside the template change. The
diff in code review tells the reviewer exactly which IDs / classes / tag
counts moved.

## The frozen template

Per the user's standing constraint
([[feedback_report_template_frozen]]),
`optimus/templates/report.html` is frozen don't restyle markup, CSS,
labels, section IDs, or class names without an explicit user request.
Per [[feedback_safe_report_self_contained]], the rendered HTML must stay
fully offline-safe (no `<script>` tags, no CDN / remote `src=` /
`href=` resource loads, no `@import`, no `url(http…)` in CSS). Both
guarantees are locked by tests:

* `test_renderer_structure_snapshot.py::test_self_containment_invariant`
* `test_report_a11y.py::test_report_is_self_contained_offline`

## Public-API stability

The package's contract the names that external callers
(`analyze.py`, `api.py`, the test suite, third-party forks) MUST keep
finding is enumerated and locked by:

`test_renderer_structure_snapshot.py::TestPublicAPIPreserved`

Currently asserted: `render`, `render_raw`, `_finding_to_dict`,
`build_donut_svg`, `build_hot_frames_table`, `redact_frame_name`,
`_BoundedFileCache`, `_read_source_snippet`, `_markdown_to_safe_html`,
`_build_line_drilldown_callsite_index`.

Adding to that list is a deliberate stability promise; removing a name
is a breaking change requiring a major-version bump.

## Remaining clusters (the follow-up PR roadmap)

The Plan agent's structural map flagged five clusters in `_internal.py`
worth extracting. Three have shipped (`call_tree_renderer` v0.12.8,
`doc_event_renderer` v0.12.10, `line_drilldown` v0.12.12).
Remaining two:

| Cluster | Approx LOC | Coupling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✓ `call_tree_renderer` (done in v0.12.8) | 240 | Weak | `_render_call_tree_panel`, `_render_call_tree_node`, `_ct_is_user_frame`, `_ct_is_sql_leaf`, `_ct_is_other_frame`. Self-contained tree rendering. |
| ✓ `doc_event_renderer` (done in v0.12.10) | 376 | Moderate | `_extract_target_doc`, `_attach_action_context`, `_build_doc_event_breakdown`, plus 6 helpers + constants. Self-contained at module-import time despite "Moderate" coupling at analyze-time. |
| ✓ `line_drilldown` (done in v0.12.12) | 416 (scoped) | Internal | `_render_line_drilldown_panel`, `_build_line_drilldown_callsite_index`, `_make_line_drilldown_lookup`, `_phase2_invoked`, `_render_phase2_function_table`, `_render_phase2_diff_table` + 3 back-compat aliases. Semi-public `analyze.py` calls `_build_line_drilldown_callsite_index` via the package shim. Smaller than the README's 840-LOC estimate because `_find_call_line_in_function_body` (AST-walking helper) + `_retarget_phase1_callsites_to_drilldown_leaf` + `_root_cause_key` / `_group_findings_by_root_cause` stay with the still-pending finding_enrichment cluster. |
| ✓ `finding_enrichment` (done in v0.12.16 + v0.12.19 + v0.12.26) | ~700 LOC total, now fully extracted | HIGH (resolved via v0.12.23's `source_resolution.py` prep) | Phase 1 (v0.12.16): `_root_cause_key`, `_group_findings_by_root_cause`, `_normalize_callsite` + `_GROUPING_SEVERITY_RANK`. Phase 2 (v0.12.19): `_find_node_in_tree`, `_walk_drilldown_chain`, `_attach_drilldown_chains`. Phase 3 (v0.12.26): `_finding_to_dict` (~200 LOC), `_attach_representative_callsites`, `_expand_self_time_snippets`, `_retarget_phase1_callsites_to_drilldown_leaf`, `_find_call_line_in_function_body`, `_markdown_to_safe_html`, `_read_function_body_snippet`, `_SQL_REDFLAG_FINDING_TYPES`. |
| `render()` orchestrator | 812 | Core | The big function itself. Could be split into per-phase helpers within `_internal.py`, but a per-module split isn't natural it's an orchestrator, not a section. Keep integrated. |

Each follow-up PR uses the recipe above. The structural snapshot is the
shared safety net; the public-API tests are the contract harness.
