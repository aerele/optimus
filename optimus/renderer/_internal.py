"""HTML report renderer for a Optimus Session.

Renders a single admin-scoped report: full data including raw SQL with
literal values, request headers, form data, and complete stack traces.
Gated to System Manager + the recording user via Frappe's File
permission hook (see permissions.py:file_has_permission).

The template is loaded directly from the file system (not via Frappe's
Jinja environment) so the renderer is unit-testable in isolation and
doesn't depend on a running site.
