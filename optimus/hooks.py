# Desk assets (Phase 5)
# ---------------------
# The floating start/stop widget is injected into every Desk page. The widget
# JS itself checks for the System Manager / Optimus User role before showing,
# so users without permission see nothing.

# v0.5.2: cache-buster is now the file's mtime + __version__ combined.
# Pre-v0.5.2 we used __version__ alone, which meant any JS/CSS change
# between releases shipped invisibly to browsers still holding the
# previous version's cached file (Frappe's dev server sends
# Cache-Control: max-age=43200, 12h). A real user report showed
# realtime-event code shipped in v0.5.2 was still running the v0.5.1
# HTTP-polling code in the browser because the cache-buster URL
# /assets/.../floating_widget.js?v=0.5.1 was unchanged the version
# wasn't bumped when JS was edited. Using mtime auto-invalidates on
# every file edit during development and still includes __version__
# so release-to-release upgrades invalidate cleanly on production
# (where mtimes are stable but version differs).

# Boot session
# ------------
# Attaches `optimus_enabled` to `frappe.boot` so the floating widget
# can hide itself when the master kill-switch is off. Without this,
# an admin who disables Optimus Settings still sees the widget
# which is a dead button (clicking Start does nothing because
# before_request short-circuits). See floating_widget.js for the
# corresponding client-side guard.

# Request lifecycle (Phase 1)
# ---------------------------
# These hooks run AFTER frappe's own recorder hooks, so by the time
# `before_request` runs, frappe.recorder.record() has already been called
# (and is a no-op without the global flag). Our hook then decides per-user
# whether to force-activate the recorder for this request.
#
# For HTTP, after_request runs in application()'s finally BEFORE frappe.recorder.dump() (WSGI ClosingIterator), so the recorder hash isn't written yet data to attach must ride an Optimus sidecar key merged at analyze time, never an RMW of the recorder hash (jobs reverse the order: dump before after_job).

# Background job lifecycle (Phase 2)
# ----------------------------------
# These mirror the request hooks. The frappe.enqueue monkey-patch in
# optimus/__init__.py injects `_profiler_session_id` into job
# kwargs at enqueue time and `before_job` reads (and pops) it to decide
# whether to activate recording for this job.
#
# This is how a customer's "save Sales Invoice → submit" flow captures
# both the synchronous HTTP requests AND the background jobs that the
# submit triggers (GL postings, stock updates, etc.) under one session.

# access in case someone guesses the file name.
