"""Cached reader for Optimus Settings.

Every request goes through ``hooks_callbacks.before_request`` which
checks ``is_enabled()``: reading the Single doc directly on every
request would be a DB hit per request. We cache the resolved config
in Redis with a version key; the DocType controller bumps the key
on save.

Falls back to ``frappe.conf`` for thresholds when the setting is
unset or the DocType row doesn't exist yet (fresh install, pre-
migration). That preserves the pre-v0.5.2 behavior where thresholds
lived in ``site_config.json``.
"""

from dataclasses import dataclass, field

# NOTE: frappe is imported lazily inside each function rather than at
# module top. Importing at top forces every unit test that touches
# ``from optimus import settings`` to run under bench, which
# would exclude pure-logic tests from the plain-pytest path. All
# runtime callers (hooks, analyzers) import inside a Frappe request
# context, so the lazy import is free there.


# Frozen default values. Matches the constants that USED to live in
# individual analyzers before v0.5.2 centralized configuration. Kept
# in this module so analyzers never have to know about DocType shape.
#
# v0.5.2 round 4: cache threshold bumped from 10 → 50. We don't time
# individual cache lookups (sidecar captures name + args, not wall
# time), so every Redundant Cache finding reports impact=0ms. A 10×
# loop at 0ms impact is indistinguishable from framework background
# noise; a 50× loop is a clear pattern. 50 also matches the
# severity=High multiplier, so low-count loops that DID previously
# emit at Medium (with unknown impact) were the worst kind of noise.
