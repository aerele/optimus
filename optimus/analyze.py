"""Background-job entry point: analyze a finished session.

Triggered by `api.stop()` via `frappe.enqueue("optimus.analyze.run", ...)`.
Reads all recordings for the session from Redis, runs the six analyzers,
persists the results into the Optimus Session DocType, and publishes a
realtime notification so the UI can navigate to the report.

State transitions on the Optimus Session row:
    Stopping  →  Analyzing  →  Ready    (happy path)
    Stopping  →  Analyzing  →  Failed   (uncaught exception)

The Redis state for the session is cleaned up at the end of a successful
run — the source recordings are deleted from RECORDER_REQUEST_HASH and the
profiler:session:* keys are removed. Failed runs do NOT clean up, so a
developer can manually retry the analyze.
