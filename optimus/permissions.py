"""Server-side permission gates for profiler artifacts.

Currently exposes one gate: a `has_permission` for the File DocType that
double-checks downloads of the profiler report. The UI hides the
"Download Report" button from non-admin/non-owner users, but a malicious
user who guessed the file URL could try to fetch it directly this
gate makes that fail.

v0.6.0 Round 7: safe-mode reports were removed. The single remaining
report (raw_report_file + raw_report_pdf_file) is admin-scoped via
this gate.
