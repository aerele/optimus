"""Sensitive-data redaction pure functions, no Frappe imports.

Two responsibilities:

  * :func:`redact_sensitive`: walks a dict / list and replaces values
    under keys whose name contains a sensitive substring
    (``password``, ``api_key``, ``token``, …) with ``"<REDACTED:keyname>"``.
    Used for ``form_dict``, ``headers``, and any nested envelope.

  * :func:`redact_sql_literals`: replaces literal RHS values in
    ``<sensitive_column> = '...'`` SQL comparisons with ``'<REDACTED>'``.
    Best-effort regex; misses UPDATE SET clauses and obscure shapes,
    but covers the >95% case (``WHERE password = 'admin123'`` is the
    canonical leak vector).

Pre-v0.7.x+ these helpers lived inside ``renderer.py`` and ran ONLY at
render time, which meant raw values still landed in Redis + the
persisted DocType JSON blobs (``top_queries_json``, ``technical_detail_json``,
``Optimus Background Job.error``). Customers who shared their report or
backed up their DB exfiltrated data they didn't realize they had.

v0.7.x+ the recorder-patch path in ``optimus/__init__.py`` calls these
at CAPTURE time so raw values never enter Redis. The renderer still
calls them as defense-in-depth (catches anything the patch didn't
e.g. older sessions written under the previous contract).

Settings-driven extension: every function accepts an ``extra_keys`` /
``extra_columns`` tuple so customers can add domain-specific patterns
(``recovery_code``, ``otp_seed``, ``bank_account``, …) via Optimus
Settings without forking. Extension is ADDITIVE there's no API to
remove a default pattern; a config typo can't accidentally disable
redaction of a known-sensitive key.

This module imports nothing from Frappe so the recorder-patch path
(which runs at app-import, before some Frappe internals are ready)
can rely on it.
