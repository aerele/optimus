"""Boot-session hook.

Runs once per Desk session init (before any page renders) to attach
``optimus_enabled`` to ``frappe.boot``. The floating widget reads
this value synchronously to decide whether to mount itself so a
site admin toggling ``Optimus Settings ▸ Profiler Enabled`` off
hides the widget on the next Desk load, without needing a separate
HTTP round-trip to the settings endpoint.
