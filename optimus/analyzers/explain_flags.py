"""Analyzer: parse EXPLAIN output for red flags.

The recorder captures `EXPLAIN <query>` for every SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE but
nobody reads the result. This analyzer walks every EXPLAIN row and surfaces
the four most actionable red flags:

    type == "ALL"          → full table scan (no index used)
    Extra: "Using filesort"  → sorting on disk
    Extra: "Using temporary" → temp table created
    filtered < 10            → reading much more than returned

Each match becomes a finding tagged by table. Findings are deduplicated by
(finding_type, table) — if 50 queries hit the same full-scan table, we
report it once with the cumulative impact.
