"""Analyzer: reconcile pyinstrument call tree with SQL recordings.

The single highest-value analyzer added in v0.3.0. Walks a per-recording
pyinstrument frame tree, grafts each captured SQL call onto the deepest
matching user-code frame, and produces a unified tree where every node
knows both its Python self-time AND the SQL queries that fired underneath
it.

Findings emitted:
  - Slow Hot Path (F1): subtree consumes >25% of action wall time AND >200ms
  - Hook Bottleneck (F3): same as F1, but the subtree root is a doc-event hook
  - Repeated Hot Frame (F2): same redacted frame in ≥3 actions, ≥500ms total

Aggregates:
  - hot_frames_json: top-20 leaderboard of hottest frames in the session
  - session_time_breakdown_json: SQL ms + per-app Python ms for the donut

Terminology note (U1): internal field names use ``cumulative_ms``
(pyinstrument's term — self_time + descendant time). The
user-facing report tags the same value as ``consolidated``. This
split is intentional — don't rename one to match the other without
a project-owner sign-off.

# The semantic question for the Repeated Hot Frame finding is:
#
#     "If this function shows up as a hot frame, can the user act on it?"
#
# For SQL N+1 / Slow Hot Path, the answer is "walk past frappe/* to blame
# user code." Repeated Hot Frame is different: it asks "is this function
# itself worth optimizing?" Document.run_method, permissions.has_permission,
# naming.make_autoname, and most of frappe/core/* and frappe/model/* are
# INSIDE frappe/* yet legitimately slow optimization targets — they run
# the user's hooks, their permission rules, or their custom naming
# configuration. Surfacing them in the leaderboard is correct.
#
# So we skip only:
#   1. optimus/*                 — always (our own tool)
#   2. /frappe/utils/                    — data conversion, password, redis wrapper
#   3. /frappe/handler.py, /frappe/app.py — request dispatch plumbing

#                                          client, pyinstrument, pytz, dateutil

# Everything else — including most of frappe/*, all of erpnext/*, and
# all user apps — is KEPT so users see legitimate optimization targets
# like "Document.run_method consumed 2.4s across 12 actions."

# v0.5.1: suffix matches (via endswith). Specific framework plumbing
# files where every request passes through the same function on its way
# from gunicorn to the user's endpoint. Surfacing these in the Repeated
# Hot Frame leaderboard is meaningless — they're always going to be in
# every action because they ARE the dispatch pipeline. Report on file

	"""Recursively remove optimus/* frames from the tree.

	When a profiler frame is found, its CHILDREN are grafted up to the
	parent in place of the profiler frame itself. This preserves any
	user-code subtree that happens to be under a profiler frame
	(pathological but theoretically possible) while removing the
	profiler frame from view.

	Context: a production report on a fast request
	(GET /api/method/frappe.realtime.can_subscribe_doctype, 47 ms)
	showed its call tree as

	    application  (47 ms)
	     └─ init_request  (31 ms)
	         └─ call  (31 ms)
	             └─ before_request  (31 ms)   ← optimus
	                 └─ snapshot  (31 ms)     ← optimus
	                     └─ _read_db  (13 ms) ← optimus

	67% of the action's time was attributed to the profiler's own
	infra snapshot. The root cause was _start_pyi_session being
	called BEFORE infra_capture.snapshot() in before_request — the
	snapshot was still on the call stack when pyinstrument began
	sampling. The primary fix (v0.5.1) reorders the hook so the
	snapshot happens first. This tree-strip pass is belt-and-
	suspenders: even with the correct ordering, pyi can still catch
	a single sample of ``before_request`` returning or a capture
	wrap frame during the action, and the stored tree should never
	show profiler frames regardless.

	Modifies the tree in place for performance (per-action trees
	can be hundreds of kilobytes) and returns the same node for
	chaining in the analyze pipeline.

	v0.5.1: derived from the FILENAME's first path segment (not the
	function name), with additional filters to keep Python stdlib /
	synthetic / third-party frames from polluting the bucket list.

	A real production donut showed these noise buckets — all 0ms each:

	    Python (inspect.py)    — Python stdlib (single-segment filename)
	    Python (functools.py)  — Python stdlib
	    Python (MySQLdb)       — third-party, pyinstrument stripped

	                             filter missed it
	    Python (<built-in>)    — pyinstrument synthetic for C builtins

	All four should collapse to the ``[other]`` catch-all. The rules
	that route them correctly:

	  1. Synthetic function names (``<root>``, ``<sql>``, ``<built-in>``,
	     ``<string>``, anything wrapped in angle brackets) → [other]
	  2. Synthetic filenames wrapped in angle brackets → [other]
	  3. Filenames containing ``site-packages/`` or ``dist-packages/``
	     (third-party libs) → [other]
	  4. Single-segment filenames (``inspect.py``, ``functools.py``) —
	     these are stdlib or loose scripts, not Frappe apps → [other]
	  5. ``apps/<name>/`` marker → ``<name>``
	  6. First path segment of a multi-segment filename, filtered to
	     actual installed Frappe apps via ``frappe.get_installed_apps()``
	     when available — otherwise accept the first segment (legacy
	     behavior, used by unit tests that can't import frappe)

	Handles the common pyinstrument path shapes:
	  - ``frappe/handler.py``                        → "frappe"
	  - ``optimus/capture.py``               → "optimus"
