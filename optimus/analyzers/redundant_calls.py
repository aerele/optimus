"""Analyzer: detect redundant frappe.get_doc / cache.get_value / has_permission calls.

Reads the per-recording sidecar argument log captured by the wraps in
capture.py, buckets entries by (fn_name, identifier_safe), and emits
one Redundant Call finding per bucket whose count exceeds a configurable
threshold.

Bucket key uses identifier_safe (sha256 hash) for redundancy
detection so equivalent values cluster regardless of literal text.
The finding's technical_detail_json carries BOTH identifier_safe AND
identifier_raw the renderer uses identifier_raw.
