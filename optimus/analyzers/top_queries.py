"""Analyzer: top N slowest queries across the session + slow-query findings.

Builds the `top_queries` aggregate (used by the report renderer to draw
the slowest-queries leaderboard) and emits a `Slow Query` finding for a
slow single query in that leaderboard (> 200ms by default).

The leaderboard is scoped to the user's *own* app code: queries whose
blame callsite resolves to framework / third-party code are dropped
before truncating to top N they're noise the developer can't act on
and they crowd real application queries out of the list. The complete,
unfiltered per-query list is still available in the per-action breakdown.
