"""Analyzer: per-action breakdown.

Produces one Optimus Action row per recording, with a humanized label
derived best-effort from the recording's path/cmd/form_dict. The action
row is the unit the customer sorts/filters by in the report "which step
of my flow took the longest?".

Label detection strategy:
    1. RQ Jobs: "Job: <last component of method name>"
    2. frappe.client.{save,insert,submit,cancel,delete}: "<Verb> <DocType>"
    3. frappe.client.get_list: "List <DocType>"
    4. Other cmd: use the cmd verbatim
    5. Fallback: "<METHOD> <path>"
