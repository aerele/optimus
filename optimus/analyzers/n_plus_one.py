"""Analyzer: true N+1 query detection by callsite.

The single highest-leverage insight in the report. Groups queries by
(normalized_query, callsite_file, callsite_line) — i.e. queries that have
the same SQL shape AND were issued from the same line of Python code.
A group with more than `MIN_OCCURRENCES` queries is almost always a Python
loop fetching its data one row at a time.

This is what makes the recorder's stack capture worth its overhead. The
existing recorder counts "exact_copies" and "normalized_copies" but doesn't
attribute them to a callsite, so it can't tell the difference between
"the same query ran 50 times because it's in a loop" and "the same query
ran 50 times from 50 different places in the code". Our grouping by
callsite makes the distinction.
