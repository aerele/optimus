"""Shared types for the analyzer pipeline.

Every analyzer is a pure function with this signature:

    analyze(recordings: list[dict], context: AnalyzeContext) -> AnalyzerResult

The analyzer reads the recording dicts (already enriched by analyze.py with
sqlparse-formatted queries, EXPLAIN output, normalized queries, and
exact/normalized copy counts) and returns:

    actions   — Optimus Action child rows (only per_action populates this)
    findings  — Optimus Finding child rows (each analyzer may emit findings)
    aggregate — top-level dict-shaped data (e.g. top_queries, table_breakdown)
    warnings  — non-fatal issues to surface in the report

Pure means: no Frappe DB access, no Redis access, no I/O. Analyzers operate
only on the data passed in. Side-effects are limited to the AnalyzerResult
they return. The orchestrator (analyze.py) merges all results and persists
them once.

The one deliberate exception is the shared framework/third-party classifier
below, which consults ``_installed_apps_for_site`` — a per-job-cached
``frappe.get_installed_apps()`` read that degrades to ``None`` off-bench. So the
classifier (and every analyzer that calls it) still runs and stays fixture-
testable in the unit suite; the lookup only sharpens classification on a live
site (an installed app named like a lib is rescued as user code).

This makes analyzers trivially unit-testable from JSON fixtures and easy to
reason about: each one is a pure data transformation.

# Frappe's DocType Data field caps at 140 characters. Apps with deeply-
# nested module paths push titles over that limit and crash the analyze
# pipeline with CharacterLengthExceededError. A production session on
# jewellery_erpnext hit this with an N+1 title:
#
#   Same query ran 65× at jewellery_erpnext/jewellery_erpnext/jewellery_
#   erpnext/doctype/parent_manufacturing_order/parent_manufacturing_order
#   .py:503
#
# That's 144 chars — just past the 140 limit. Shortening the filename to
# its last 2 path segments yields:
#
#   Same query ran 65× at parent_manufacturing_order/parent_manufacturing
#   _order.py:503
#
# ~90 chars — well under the limit — and still uniquely identifies the
# file for navigation. The full absolute path remains in the finding's
# technical_detail_json so the developer can jump to it directly.
#
# Analyzers should use this for TITLES only; customer_description and
# technical_detail_json can keep the full path for disambiguation.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# v0.5.3: "Projected after fix" timing heuristics
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Per-finding-type speedup factors. Applied to the CURRENT average per-query
# time to estimate what the same query would cost after the recommended
# fix. These are ceiling estimates — a real fix could do better or worse,
# but they give the developer a rough sense of "is this worth my afternoon".
#
# Derivations:
#   Full Table Scan: scan O(N) → index lookup O(log N). For N=10k-10M the
#                    ratio is ~20×. Use 0.05.
#   Missing Index:   same — the suggestion IS to add an index.
#   Filesort:        sort cost is O(N log N); with an index-ordered read,
#                    the sort disappears but the read cost remains. Typical
#                    observed speedup on Frappe DocTypes is ~3×. Use 0.30.
#   Temporary Table: materialization cost goes away when a covering index
#                    supports the GROUP BY / DISTINCT. ~2× speedup. Use 0.50.
#   Low Filter Ratio: the fix is selectivity, so projected_time ≈ current ×
#                    (filtered% / 100). Special-cased in explain_flags —
#                    not a simple factor.
