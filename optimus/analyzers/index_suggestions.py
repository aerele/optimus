"""Analyzer: aggregated index suggestions across the session.

Wraps the existing
`frappe.core.doctype.recorder.recorder._optimize_query` (which uses the
`DBOptimizer` heuristic) to identify a single best missing index per query.
We run it across the union of unique normalized queries in the session,
then dedupe and aggregate suggestions by (table, column) so a customer
sees one suggestion per missing index — with the cumulative time it would
save and the queries that would benefit.

This is the per-session aggregation that the existing per-request
optimizer doesn't do. Per-request, you only see the index for THAT
request's queries; per-session, you see the index that would help across
the whole flow.

# v0.5.1: Classify exceptions from DBOptimizer / sql_metadata.

# sql_metadata is a third-party SQL parser with well-known limitations: it
# trips on correlated subqueries, complex ORDER BY expressions containing
# functions (if/locate/coalesce), window functions, CTEs, and a few other
# shapes Frappe apps legitimately emit. When it can't parse a query, it
# raises either ``ValueError: too many values to unpack`` (from an internal
# tuple unpacking) or ``TypeError`` (from an unexpected None in its
# token stream). These are PARSER LIMITATIONS — the user cannot rewrite
# their query to make sql_metadata happy, and they cannot add an index to
# fix a parse failure anyway.
#
# Pre-v0.5.1 the analyzer logged every parse failure to Frappe's Error
# Log and emitted a loud "Could not analyze N of M queries" warning.
# For a production session running ERPNext's item search dialog (which
# has the exact offending query shape above), this filled the Error Log
# with TypeError / ValueError tracebacks that looked like profiler bugs,
# and the warning made the user think they were missing optimization
# opportunities they could act on.
#
# v0.5.1: parser-limitation exceptions are counted but NOT logged to
# the Error Log, and the user-facing warning is softer — it explains
# that sql_metadata can't parse these shapes and there's nothing to fix.
# Real errors (AttributeError, ProgrammingError, RuntimeError, etc.)
# still go to the Error Log and still produce the loud warning, because
# those might indicate a profiler bug worth investigating.

# These columns are updated on every save (`modified`, `modified_by`,
# `idx`), on insert (`creation`, `owner`), on submit/cancel (`docstatus`),

# on child tables). On any non-trivially-written table the maintenance cost
# of an index there dwarfs the read-side gain — and even where the per-
# insert cost would equal any other index, surfacing these nudges the

# a tool's say-so. The query's EXPLAIN row is still in the report if
# someone wants to make that call themselves.
