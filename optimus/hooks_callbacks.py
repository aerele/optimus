"""Frappe lifecycle hook callbacks.

These functions are wired into `before_request` / `after_request` (and in
Phase 2, `before_job` / `after_job`) via `hooks.py`. Their job is to:

1. Decide whether the current request belongs to an active profiler session.
2. If yes, activate `frappe.recorder` for this request only (per-user
   isolation — other users' concurrent traffic is NOT recorded).
3. After the request, register the new recording UUID with the session
   so the analyze pipeline can find all recordings that belong to a flow.

Activation strategy
-------------------
We do NOT call `frappe.recorder.start()`, because that flips a global flag
that records every request from every user. Instead, we directly invoke
`frappe.recorder.record(force=True)` only when the current user has an
active profiler session.

Hook order
----------
Frappe loads `frappe`'s own hooks first, then app hooks. So on each request:

  1. `frappe.recorder.record()`        — frappe's own (no-op without flag)
  2. `optimus.hooks_callbacks.before_request()` — ours, may activate
  3. <request handling>
  4. `frappe.recorder.dump()`          — frappe's own, dumps the recorder
                                          we activated
  5. `optimus.hooks_callbacks.after_request()` — ours, registers
                                          the new UUID with the session

Step 4 happens before step 5 because frappe's `after_request` runs before
ours (loaded first). That ordering is essential — we need the recording
to be dumped to Redis before we ask the analyze pipeline to fetch it later.

# v0.5.1: Skip-list for instrumentation-noise endpoints. Any HTTP request
# whose ``cmd`` starts with one of these prefixes is NOT recorded against
# the user's active profiler session, even though everything else about
# the request (auth, user, active session) would normally mean "record me".
#
# Why: these are the profiler's own widget-polling calls and Frappe's own
# Recorder doctype whitelisted methods. They fire during an active session
# but represent instrumentation overhead, not application work the user is
# trying to optimize. Capturing them pollutes:
#
#   - per_action rows (N extra "optimus.api.status" rows per session)
#   - top_queries / table_breakdown (queries from status polling / recorder
#     lookups obscure the real hot spots)
#   - the auto-generated "Steps to Reproduce" bullet list — the widget
#     polls every ~2s while Recording, so a 30-second flow ends up with
#     a reproducer list that's 90% status polls
#   - total wall-clock / total query totals on the Optimus Session form
#
# Filtered at capture time (before_request) rather than at display time so
# ALL downstream analyzers see a clean recording list, not just auto-notes.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Background-job status tracking — authoritative writes from the worker
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pre-fix, the bg-job tracking pipeline relied on analyze re-reading each
# enqueued job's terminal status from RQ at persist time
# (``analyze._capture_job_terminal_status`` → ``rq.Job.fetch``). Two failure
# modes left rows wrong on the report:
#
#   1. ``enqueue_after_commit=True`` jobs: ``frappe.enqueue`` returns None
#      for deferred dispatch (see ``frappe/utils/background_jobs.py`` 's
#      ``if enqueue_after_commit: ... return``), so the enqueue patch's
#      ``record_job`` call in ``optimus/__init__.py`` is skipped (its
#      ``if job is not None`` guard fails). The method name was never
#      written to the jobs hash → blank ``method`` column on the row.
#
#   2. Short jobs whose RQ record was GC'd before analyze persisted:
#      ``Job.fetch`` raises ``NoSuchJobError``, which the ``except
#      Exception: pass`` in ``_capture_job_terminal_status`` swallows.
#      No status/times were written → row defaulted to status=Running
#      with NULL started_at/ended_at.
#
# These two helpers move the authoritative writes into the hooks, where:
#   * before_job calls ``_track_bg_job_started`` right after popping the
#     marker — has access to the method arg (fixes #1) and the worker's
#     wall-clock time (fixes the "no started_at" half of #2).
#   * after_job calls ``_track_bg_job_finished`` in its finally block —
#     RQ record is still alive, so we capture status + ended_at +
#     duration_ms ourselves (fixes the other half of #2).
#
# analyze's existing ``_capture_job_terminal_status`` stays as the fallback
# for jobs the hooks couldn't cover (worker SIGKILL on timeout, crash before
# after_job fires — frappe runs after_job in a try/finally so this is rare
# but possible). Its persist-time loop only fires for jobs whose status the
# hooks did NOT already write (``if not _jm.get("status"):``), so no
# double-work and no overwrite churn.
#
# Late-finish DocType fallback (v0.7.x+):
# ``analyze._bg_wait_for_pending_jobs`` is hard-capped at
# ``_MAX_BG_JOB_WAIT_SECONDS = 300`` (analyze.py:215). A job that runs longer
# than 5 min ALWAYS exceeds the cap; at the cap, ``_finalize_pending_statuses``
# marks the still-active job as ``status="Running"`` (no end times — analyze
# can't predict when it'll finish), ``_persist`` writes the Optimus
# Background Job child row from that snapshot, and ``_cleanup_redis`` then
# DELETES the jobs hash. When the long job actually finishes minutes later,
# the worker's ``_track_bg_job_finished`` writes to a deleted Redis key
# (orphan) and the persisted row stays ``Running`` forever — there's no
# in-band path to update it because re-analyze isn't viable (recordings /
# meta / jobs hash are all gone).
#
# Closing the gap: after ``set_job_status`` writes to the Redis hash,
# ``_track_bg_job_finished`` ALSO checks the Optimus Session DocType row;
# if the session has finalized (status in {"Ready", "Failed"}) and a child
# row exists at ``status="Running"``, it writes the terminal status +
# ended_at + duration_ms + error directly via ``frappe.db.set_value`` +
# commit. Guarded by an idempotency check (only updates Running placeholders
# — never clobbers a fresher Completed) and a SEPARATE try/except from the
# Redis path so neither failure suppresses the other.
#
# Both helpers are best-effort: any failure is swallowed so a tracking bug
# can never break the user's actual job.
