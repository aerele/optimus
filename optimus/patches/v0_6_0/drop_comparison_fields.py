"""v0.6.0: drop the session-comparison / baseline-pinning feature.

Removes two fields from Optimus Session:
  - compared_to_session
  - is_baseline

Frappe's auto-DDL drops the columns once optimus_session.json no longer
declares them; reloading the DocType here makes that happen during
migrate. We also clear any lingering ``profiler:baseline:<label>`` cache
keys so they don't dangle pointing at deleted sessions.

Idempotent: safe to re-run. Each step is wrapped in try/except so a
partially-applied state doesn't break the migration.
