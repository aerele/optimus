"""v0.6.0 Round 7: drop safe-mode reporting.

Removes three fields:
  - Optimus Session.safe_report_file
  - Optimus Session.safe_report_pdf_file
  - Optimus Settings.safe_report_include_source_lines

Frappe's auto-DDL handles dropping the columns when the .json no longer
declares them, but we explicitly nuke any attached File rows pointing at
the old fields so they don't dangle as orphaned private files. The
File records are only deleted after the session row's column is gone,
because deleting the File first would still leave the session row
pointing at a missing URL.

Idempotent: safe to re-run. Each step is wrapped in a try/except so a
partially-applied state (e.g. column already dropped, file already
gone) doesn't break the migration.
