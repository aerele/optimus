"""v0.6.x: rename the ``Profiler Phase 2 Run`` DocType to
``Profiler Phase Two Run`` so the name passes the Frappe Title-Case
convention (digits-in-name was a Lens-audit warning, item 2.6 of the
audit-response plan).

This patch describes a migration that ran BEFORE the v0.7.0 app rename
(``frappe_profiler`` → ``optimus``); the historical DocType names here
are intentionally Profiler-prefixed. v0.7.0's ``rename_doctypes_to_optimus``
runs afterwards and renames ``Profiler Phase Two Run`` to ``Optimus Phase
Two Run`` as part of the broader DocType rename.

Idempotent + defensive:

1. No-op when the old DocType is already gone (fresh installs already
   ship with the new name in JSON Frappe creates the new DocType
   directly).
2. No-op when the new name already exists alongside the old (someone
   ran a partial migration). In that case the renamed table would
   conflict bail out and let the operator resolve it manually.
3. Uses ``frappe.rename_doc("DocType", old, new)`` which handles:
     - renaming the row in ``tabDocType``,
     - renaming the underlying SQL table (``tabProfiler Phase 2 Run``
       → ``tabProfiler Phase Two Run``),
     - updating every child row's ``parenttype`` column on the parent
       (``tabProfiler Session``'s ``phase_2_runs`` table),
     - clearing the cached schema.
4. Clears the settings cache as a safety net for any stale references.

Trade-off acknowledged in ``AUDIT_BASELINE.md``: the in-code field name
on the parent (``phase_2_runs``) stays snake_case the audit's
Title-Case rule applies only to DocType names, not field names.
